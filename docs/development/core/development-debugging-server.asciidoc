=== Debugging the Kibana server

To debug the Kibana server using an interactive debugger, it's much easier to do so running Kibana without dev mode.
Additionally, when the optimizer runs with the debugger attached, it takes a significantly longer amount of time. To quickly get debugging,
start up Kibana without a basepath (as when it changes we have to reoptimize) and without the debugger attached:

["source","shell"]
-----------
node ./scripts/kibana.js -c ./config/kibana.dev.yml
-----------

and after Kibana has come online and gotten past the optimizer, kill the process and then start it up with the debugger:

["source","shell"]
-----------
node --inspect-brk ./scripts/kibana.js -c ./config/kibana.dev.yml
-----------

Once Kibana is up and running, open Chrome and go to `chrome://inspect/#devices` and click "Open Dedicated DevTools for Node". The debugger should attach at this point, and you can place breakpoints.
